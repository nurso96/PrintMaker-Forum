## Tips for Great WIP Posts
1. **Context is key**: Explain what you're trying to achieve
2. **Show your process**: Multiple iterations are fascinating
3. **Ask specific questions**: "How can I improve the aerodynamics?" vs "What do you think?"
4. **Tag your tools**: #OpenSCAD #FreeCAD #AI #DeepSeek

Feel free to share your hacks and personal workflows.

## AI CAD Workflow Fundamentals

### 1. **Prompt Engineering for 3D Models**
The key to great AI-generated CAD is specific, detailed prompts:

\`\`\`
‚ùå Bad: "Create a gear"
‚úÖ Good: "Create a 20-tooth involute gear, module 2.5, 20-degree pressure angle, with 6mm center hole and chamfered edges"
\`\`\`

### 2. **Iterative Refinement**
- Start with basic shapes
- Add details incrementally
- Use AI for optimization passes
- Always validate geometry

### 3. **Popular AI Tools Integration**
- **DeepSeek**: Natural language to OpenSCAD
- **GPT-4**: Complex parametric modeling
- **Custom Models**: Fine-tuned for specific domains

### 4. **Quality Control Checklist**
- [ ] Manifold geometry
- [ ] Proper wall thickness
- [ ] No floating elements
- [ ] Print-friendly orientation

## Share Your Workflows!
Post your favorite prompts, tools, and techniques. Let's build a comprehensive knowledge base together! ü§ñ‚ö°`,
      categoryId: tutorialsCategory.id,
      subcategoryId: tutorialsCategory.subcategories[1].id, // AI Guides

## How to Submit Great Ideas

### 1. **Problem Statement**
Start with the problem you're trying to solve:
- What workflow is currently frustrating?
- What takes too much time?
- What's impossible with current tools?

### 2. **Proposed Solution**  
Describe your idea in detail:
- How would it work?
- What would the user experience be?
- Any technical considerations?

### 3. **Impact Assessment**
Help us prioritize:
- Who would benefit? (beginners, experts, specific industries)
- How often would this be used?
- What's the learning curve?

## Current Hot Topics üî•
- Real-time collaborative modeling
- AI-powered error detection
- Mobile CAD companion app
- Integration with major CAD platforms
- Advanced material simulation

## Voting System
Use reactions to vote on ideas:
- üëç Love it!
- ü§î Interesting, needs refinement  
- üöÄ This should be prioritized
- üí° I have additional ideas

I'm GeoMetrician, and I've been working with parametric CAD for over 8 years. Recently got into AI-assisted modeling and I'm blown away by what's possible!

**Current setup:**
- Primary tool: OpenSCAD + custom Python scripts  
- AI: DeepSeek for complex geometries
- Focus: Mathematical art and functional prototypes

**Random fun fact:** I once generated a 3D fractal that took 47 hours to render but looked absolutely stunning when 3D printed in translucent resin! ‚ú®

Looking forward to sharing some of my geometric experiments here. The intersection of math, AI, and fabrication is where the magic happens! üîÆ`,

**My background:**
- Traditional CNC machining and turning
- Transitioning from manual programming to AI-assisted CAD
- Love bridging old-school manufacturing with new tech

**Currently working on:** A series of precision mechanical components that would traditionally take days to program, but AI helps me iterate in minutes!

**Fun fact:** My workshop has a 1960s manual lathe right next to a modern AI workstation. The contrast is pretty wild! üîß‚öôÔ∏è

      content: `Just uploaded my latest WIP - a generative bracket design that adapts to stress patterns! 

The AI generated 47 different iterations based on FEA feedback. Still fine-tuning the support removal strategy, but the organic forms are incredible.

**Files attached:**
- bracket_v23.stl (latest iteration)
- stress_analysis.png  
- generation_params.json

Anyone have experience with variable-density infill for organic structures like this? The overhangs are tricky but I think there's a solution! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

**Print settings so far:**
- Layer height: 0.15mm
- Infill: 15% gyroid
- Supports: Tree supports (experimental)
